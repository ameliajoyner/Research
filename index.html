                  <p>Printers have come a long way; putting it at an understatement. They've become an apparent device apart of all daily lives, and life would be very different without the invention of the printer. Dating all the way back to the 200's; printing started simply as stamping (as we know it today.) Slowly, it turned into the printing press invented in the 1440's. Sooner than we know it, we created laser printing, ink printing, and 3-D/digital printing. The printer went through many trials and changes to become what we know of it today.</p></div>

        <h2 class="heading intro"><a name="block">Woodblock Printing</a></h2>
            <p>Woodblock Printing was the most basic printing processes known to date. It's basically stamping as we know it today. They would carve the reverse image onto a wooden block, thenn press the then carved block into any form of dye of ink and transfer it to whatever they needed the design, words, etc. to be at. Below is an example of a Wooden block used for printing:</p>

        <h2 class="heading intro"><a name="printing">Printing Press</a></h2>
            <p>The printing press is one of the most well know types of older dated printers we know of. Made by Johannes Gutenburg around the 1440's (aka; Enlightenment Period); It was one of the most glorified inventions of its time. Simply push down on the lever and your print was transfered easily. This was also another form of woodblock printing, however, its bigger size allowed for quicker printing and more efficiency. Below of a photo of the printing press:</p>

        <h2 class="heading intro"><a name="rotary">Rotary Press</a></h2>
            <p>Similarly to the Woodblock Printing System, the rotary press was just one big stamp. What makes it different, however, was how it was designed. The stamp and carving were curved around a large cylinder that constantly went in circles. Usually, rotarty presses were stacked upon one another to save space and resources. The press is quite a large object and took around 2 to 3 men to monitor and help the press. Below is a photo of a rotary press:</p>
        <h2 class="heading intro"><a name="Laser">Ink/Laser Printing</a></h2>
            <p>Taking a large step out of the basic stamp and go inventions, we have the laser printer. As said in the name, the laser printer used a laser beam to print out images, texts, etc. There are 6 main steps to how a laser printer works. When the needed image/text is sent to the printer, it is automatically stored in the printer's memory. Next is the step that we usually know of, waiting for it to warm up. After warming up, the drums (large cylinders with ink/toner usually in the colors of magenta, cyan, yellow, and black) begin to roll. Afterwards, the laser beams are emitted off of a  mirror and reflected onto the surface and then imprint a shape on to the surface. Next, toners begin to be attracted to the negative charge that the lasers emitted and gather to the areas where the beams were previously at. The surface is then transfered through the printer, and lastly it is roller through hot rollers causing the toner to melt onto the surface and allowing that warm to the touch feeling you get after freshly printing off a piece of paper. Below is an inside look as to what a laser/ink printer looks like:</p>
        <h2 class="heading intro"><a name="Digital">3-D/Digital Printing</a></h2>
            <p>3-D/Digital printers are the latest invention of the printer that we have made. They have very recently come out and are known for being expensive and also known for bringing a whole new aspect of printing. These printers are able to print out objects made from plastic. This makes them quite complicated to understand. If you have seen a video of someone 3-D printing an object, you understand how the machine moves. Back and forth and back and forth moving quickly and covering little area. Thisi causes the prints to take hours to even days. What you dont see are the inner works of the printer. You first start off similarly like a laser printer. Send an image to the printer and it autmatically saves it to memory. 3-D printers are aparts of addative manufacturing, basically meaning they create objects by building layers on top of one another in return, creating a larger object. Before any of this can happen, you must have your material to 3-D print with. Bio-plastic is the most common material used and is often stored on large spools, similar to yarn or crotchet yarn. You feed the material into the tube which heats up the material and prints it out on to a large l=plate, which cools down rather quickly. Below is a video which demonstrates how 3-D printers work:</p>
