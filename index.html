                  <p>Printers have come a long way; putting it at an understatement. They've become an apparent device apart of all daily lives, and life would be very different without the invention of the printer. Dating all the way back to the 200's; printing started simply as stamping (as we know it today.) Slowly, it turned into the printing press invented in the 1440's. Sooner than we know it, we created laser printing, ink printing, and 3-D/digital printing. The printer went through many trials and changes to become what we know of it today.</p></div>

        <div class="woodblock"><h2 class="heading intro"><a name="block">Woodblock Printing</a></h2>
            <p><i>Woodblock printing</i> was the most basic printing process known to date. It is stamping as we know it today. They would carve the reverse image onto a wooden block, then press the then carved block into any form of dye or ink and transfer it to whatever they needed the design, words, etc. to be at. These were mostly used during times of small civilizations, so there was no need for mass production of any type of “newspapers” or daily letters to be made consistently back then. These were used to keep track of any trading, major events, or wheat and food supplies. Before woodblock printing was invented, people would hand carve everything into tablets which was very time consuming and inefficient. There is not a sent “inventor” of the <i>Woodblock printing</i> method, however it was a quite widespread practice amongst most. There was an area to which we credit this invention to, however. In China, the Song Dynasty has the oldest records of the use of <i>Woodblock printing</i> as we know of today. It originated in China and Eastern Asia and became a widespread practice in Europe but was under the name “woodcut.” Of course, with these inventions, many improvements were made upon it. One of the most remarkable ones includes the use of a wheel with many basic lettering and symbols pre-carved onto the stamps that were then placed inside the wheel. This can be originated in China. Below is an example of a Wooden block used for printing:</p>

        <div class="printing_press"><h2 class="heading intro"><a name="printing">Printing Press</a></h2>
            <p>The printing press is one of the most well-known types of older dated printers we know of. Made by Johannes Gutenberg around the 1440's (aka; Enlightenment Period); It was one of the most glorified inventions of its time. So glorified, in fact, that it is a staple invention in the Enlightenment Period and is what started the printing revolution. Without this invention, we would not have 3-D printers or laser printers like we do today. Simply push down on the lever and your print was transferred easily. This was also another form of woodblock printing, however, its bigger size allowed for quicker printing and more efficiency. Below of a photo of the printing press:</p>

        <div class="rotary"><h2 class="heading intro"><a name="rotary">Rotary Press</a></h2>
            <p>Similarly to the Woodblock Printing System, the rotary press was just one big stamp. What makes it different, however, was how it was designed. The stamp and carving were curved around a large cylinder that constantly went in circles. Usually, rotarty presses were stacked upon one another to save space and resources. The press is quite a large object and took around 2 to 3 men to monitor and help the press. Below is a photo of a rotary press:</p>

        <div class="laser_printing"><h2 class="heading intro"><a name="Laser">Ink/Laser Printing</a></h2>
            <p>Taking a large step out of the basic stamp and go inventions, we have the <i>laser printer</i>. As said in the name, the <i>laser printer</i> used a laser beam to print out images, texts, etc. There are 6 main steps to how a <i>laser printer</i> works. When the needed image/text is sent to the printer, it is automatically stored in the printer's memory. Next is the step that we usually know of, waiting for it to warm up. After warming up, the drums (large cylinders with ink/toner usually in the colors of magenta, cyan, yellow, and black) begin to roll. Afterwards, the laser beams are emitted from a mirror and reflected onto the surface and then imprint a shape onto to the surface. Next, toners begin to be attracted to the negative charge that the lasers emitted and gather to the areas where the beams were previously at. The surface is then transferred through the printer, and lastly it is roller through hot rollers causing the toner to melt onto the surface and allowing that warm to the touch feeling you get after freshly printing off a piece of paper. The inventor of the <i>laser printer</i> is a man name Gary Starkweather. He worked for Xerox and while working there, he had an idea to use a laser to “draw” an image onto a copier drum, therefore putting his idea into action and eventually into a physical, working object. Below is an inside look as to what a <i>laser/ink printer</i> looks like:</p>

        <div class="digital_printing"><h2 class="heading intro"><a name="Digital">3-D/Digital Printing</a></h2>
            <p><i>3-D/Digital printers</i> are the latest invention of the printer that we have made. They have very recently come out and are known for being expensive and known for bringing a whole new aspect of printing. These printers can print out objects made from plastic. This makes them quite complicated to understand. If you have seen a video of someone 3-D printing an object, you understand how the machine moves. Back and forth and back and forth moving quickly and covering little area. This causes the prints to take hours to even days. What you do not see are the inner works of the printer. You first start off similarly like a laser printer. Send an image to the printer and it automatically saves it to memory. <i>3-D/Digital printers</i> are a part of additive manufacturing, meaning they create objects by building layers on top of one another in return, creating a larger object. Before any of this can happen, you must have your material to 3-D print with. Bioplastic is the most common material used and is often stored in large spools, like yarn or crotchet yarn. You feed the material into the tube which heats up the material and prints it out onto a large plate, which cools down quickly. These can be used to make a plentiful of useful items such as creating usable arms for amputees, which is a large and needed step taken to advance in the scientific field. Below is a video which demonstrates how <i>3-D/Digital printers</i>:</p>
