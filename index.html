    <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Printers have come a long way; putting it at an understatement. They've become an apparent device apart of all daily lives, and life would be very different without the invention of the printer. Dating all the way back to the 200's; printing started simply as stamping (as we know it today.) Slowly, it turned into the printing press invented in the 1440's. Sooner than we know it, we created laser printing, ink printing, and 3-D/digital printing. The printer went through many trials and changes to become what we know of it today.</p>
